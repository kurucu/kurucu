### Hi there 👋

- I live in both engineering worlds: 🧑‍💻 tech, and the 👨‍🔧 built environment. But they work well together!
- I'm currently 💪 working on https://planswiftly.com and https://pianta.io
- I'm learning how to use ExpressJS, and using it as a backend worker for Laravel. The best library I've found for creating Word documents programmatically was in JS, so this architecture seems like the best way forward.
